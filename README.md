## Motivation

Our team noticed that immigrants and refugees in Canada have a significantly higher unemployment rate compared to Canadian citizens. Employers usually prefer citizens because they value Canadian working experience. Our app provides newcomers to Canada with the perfect platform to find a source income quickly as well as gain some basic working experience in the country.

## Technology

We built the app using `flutter` and `firebase`. In the future we want to incorporate more gcp services to improve and build new features. Flutter allowed us to build for `ios` and `android` with a single code base. Using Firebase as a `backend-service` allowed us to get the app up and running quickly.
